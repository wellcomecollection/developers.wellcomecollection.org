However, our focus will remain on demonstrating the practical uses of the Wellcome Collection API. As such, some important ML topics will be covered in less detail than they deserve, and some will be skipped entirely.\n",

    "Image classification is a classic task in machine learning. By gathering thousands of examples of labelled images from a small number of classes, we can train a model to predict the class for new, unlabelled images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a model that can classify images based on categories in the collection. We're going to use a pre-trained model, which has already been exposed to on a large collection of labelled images. We'll then re-train it on our own images, taking advantage of the low-level knowledge it gained from its previous task. This is a common technique in machine learning known as fine tuning, or transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we'll fine-tune is called [ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which has been pre-trained on the [ImageNet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/). We'll use the `transformers` library to download the pre-trained model, which uses `pytorch` under the hood."

    "The categories we'll use are `portrait` and `landscape`. We want our model to learn the features of the images which contribute to their classification as portraits or landscapes. For example, portraits tend to contain features like hair, eyes, mouths, clothing, and their visual focus is usually concentrated on a single region of the image. Landscapes, however, contain features like trees, buildings, water, and their visual focus is usually spread across the image. Of course, the usual feature that distinguishes a portrait or landscape image is its aspect ratio, but our model won't have access to this information, either during training or when making predictions. We'll use square versions of the images throughout, so that the model has to make its decision based on the content of the image alone.\n",
