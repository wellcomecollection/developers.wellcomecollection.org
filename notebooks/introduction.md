## Introduction

This collection of notebooks demonstrates some of the interesting things you can do with the Wellcome Collection API, and how to make the most of it. The notebooks are written in Python, and use the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)  format.

This kind of documentation is intended for people who might benefit from practical examples, rather than exhaustive technical specs (check out the [API reference](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/api/catalogue) if you're looking for that kind of thing). For example, you might be familiar with Python (or a similar scripting language), but haven't used an open data API before. Or you might be familiar with the cultural heritage sector but haven't used this sort of data in a programming context before.

The examples here aren't exhaustive, and should just serve as inspiration for your own explorations. Each notebook introduces a concept or technique, and then provides a set of exercises to push you further. The hope is that you'll eventually abandon these notebooks and start writing your own code!

If you have an idea for a notebook that you think might be useful or interesting to others, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/developers.wellcomecollection.org/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/developers.wellcomecollection.org/pulls)!
